Today I started to learn TypeScript. My further goal is to learn Angular as well for projects. I will be using TypeScript for my upcoming projects so, it is a good tool to have in my arsenal.

I will try to complete this as fast as possible so that I can work on the projects as fast as possible.

I am following the series made by [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja). Check out the TypeScript course here ["TypeScript Crash Course"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gNhFQgS4edYLqP7LkZcFMN).
